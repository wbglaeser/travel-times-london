# Travel times across London

This package allows you to see approximate travel times across London from any given starting point. Please note that at this point postcodes are limited to central London.

Go to the directory where you want to install the script and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/wbglaeser/travel-times-london.git
```

Then to create the heatmap around a postcode simple run (you might have to check that you have all necessary packages installed). 

```
python draw_heatmap.py
```
